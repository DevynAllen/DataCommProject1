# The Python socket API is based closely on the Berkeley sockets API which
# was originally written for the C programming language.
#
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets
#
# The API is more flexible than you need, and it does some quirky things to
# provide that flexibility. I recommend tutorials instead of complete
# descriptions because those can skip the archaic bits. (The API was released
# more than 35 years ago!)
